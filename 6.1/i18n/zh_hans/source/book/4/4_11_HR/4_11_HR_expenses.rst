.. i18n: Keeping Track of Expenses
.. i18n: =========================

管理各种费用开支
=========================

.. i18n: Employee expenses are charges incurred on behalf of the company. The company then reimburses these
.. i18n: expenses to the employee. The receipts encountered most frequently are:
..

员工费用是员工为公司垫付的。公司应将这些费用报销给员工。最常见的收据有以下几种:

.. i18n: * car travel, reimbursed per unit of distance (mile or kilometer),
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * subsistence expenses, reimbursed based on the bill,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * other purchases, such as stationery and books, destined for the company but carried out by the
.. i18n:   employee.
..

* 汽车费用，每（英里或公里）费用报销,

* 生活费用，根据账单报销,

* 其他商品，例如员工使用的文具和书籍.

   *处理费用报销的过程*

.. i18n: Expenses generated by employees are grouped into periods of a week or a month. At the end of the
.. i18n: period, the employee confirms all of his expenses and a summary sheet is sent to the department
.. i18n: manager. The manager is responsible for approving all the expense requests generated by his team.
.. i18n: The expense sheet must be signed by the employee, who also attaches its receipts to the expense sheet.
..

员工费用可以一个星期一报也可以一个月一报。在一个星期或者一个月结束时，员工可以将复核好的所有费用及费用清单发
给部门经理。经理负责批准本部门所有的费用报销申请。费用清单上必须有员工的签字，同时也必须将收据附在费用清单上。

.. i18n: Once the sheet has been approved by the head of department, it is sent to the Accounting department, which registers the
.. i18n: company's liability to the employee. Accounting can then pay this invoice and reimburse the employee
.. i18n: who originally advanced the money.
..

一旦部门经理批准费用清单后，费用清单将被送到财务部门（记录了公司对员工的负债）。财务可以用支票支付报销费用
也可以以员工最初提供的支付方式支付报销费用。

.. i18n: Some receipts are for project expenses, so these can then be attached to an analytic account. The
.. i18n: costs incurred are then added to the supplementary cost of the analytic account when the invoice is
.. i18n: approved.
..

一些收据是项目费用，因此需要一个分析账户。当这些收据被批准后，这些费用被添加到分析账户的成本中。

.. i18n: You often need to invoice expenses to a customer, depending on the precise contract that has been
.. i18n: negotiated. Travelling and subsistence expenses are generally handled this way. These can be
.. i18n: charged to the customer at the end of the month if the contract price has been negotiated inclusive of
.. i18n: expenses.
..

经常会有一些在客户中产生的费用，具体的费用要根据合同情况而定。差旅费和生活费就是这样产生的。如果合同价包括
这些费用，那么可以在月底的时候向客户索取。

.. i18n: If you have to go through many steps to reclaim expenses, it can all quickly become too cumbersome,
.. i18n: especially for those employees who claim large numbers of different expense lines. If you have got a
.. i18n: good system that integrates the management of these claims, such as the one described, you can avoid
.. i18n: many problems and increase staff productivity.
..

如果你要通过很多步骤收回费用，那么会很繁琐，特别是员工那些大量的不同的费用。如果你有一个好的管理系统，那么
你可以避免很多麻烦并且提高员工的工作效率。

.. i18n: If your systems handle expenses well, then you can avoid significant losses by setting your terms of
.. i18n: sales effectively. In fixed-price contracts, expense reimbursements are usually invoiced according to
.. i18n: the actual expense. It is in your interest to systematize their treatment, and automate the process
.. i18n: to the maximum, to recharge as much as you are contractually able.
..

如果用系统处理费用，那么你可以通过有效的设置销售条款从而避免重大损失。在固定价格的合同中，费用报销通常是根
据实际发生的费用报销。这将有利于系统化处理，自动程序最大化。

.. i18n: Create templates for the various expenses accepted by the company using OpenERP's
.. i18n: product form. You could, for instance, create a product with the following parameters for the
.. i18n: reimbursement of travel expenses by car at 0.25 per kilometer:
..

公司认可通过OpenERP产品类型创建的各种费用的模板。例如，你可以创建一个 `每公里0.25元的汽车费用` 报销产品:

.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Name` : \ ``Car travel``\  ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Default Unit Of Measure` : \ ``km``\  ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Cost Price` : \ ``0.25``\  ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Sale Price` : \ ``0.30``\  ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Product Type` : \ ``Service``\  .
..

*  :guilabel:`名称` : \ ``汽车费用``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`默认计量单位` : \ ``公里``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`成本价` : \ ``0.25``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`销售价` : \ ``0.30``\  ,

*  :guilabel:`产品类型` : \ ``服务``\  .

.. i18n: The employee keeps his expenses sheet in the \ ``Draft``\   state while completing it throughout the
.. i18n: period. At the end of the period (week or month), the employee can confirm his expense form using the
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Confirm` button on the form. This puts it into the state \ ``Waiting Approval``\  .
..

员工在规定的每个周期之前应该保持它的费用清单处于 \ ``草稿``\ 状态。到达规定时期（星期或者月）时，员工通过点击 :guilabel:`确认` 按钮
来确认他的报销清单。确认后报销清单处于 \ ``等待批准``\ 状态。

.. i18n: At the end of the period, the department manager can access the list of expense forms awaiting
.. i18n: approval using the menu :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Expenses --> Expenses`.
..

在一段时期后，部门经理通过 :menuselection:`人力资源 --> 费用 --> 费用` :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Expenses --> Expenses` 访问等待批准的费用清单。

.. i18n: The department manager can then approve the expenses. Now, the :guilabel:`Invoice` button is visible which on clicking creates a supplier invoice
.. i18n: in the employee's name so that the employee can be reimbursed. An analytic account is coded onto
.. i18n: each line of the invoice. When the invoice is confirmed, general and analytic accounting entries are
.. i18n: automatically generated as they would be with any other invoice.
..

费用报销由部门经理批准。点击 :guilabel:`发票按钮` 创建供应商发票以便于员工报销。分析账户编码到每一行发票中。当发票确认后，一般的分析会计条目将自动生成。

.. i18n: If you base your invoicing on service time or analytic costs, the expense will
.. i18n: automatically be charged to the customer when the customer invoice is generated for services
.. i18n: associated with the project.
..

如果你基于服务时间或者分析成本开票，当客户发票根据相关服务项目生成时，费用将自动计入客户。

.. i18n: Invoicing from timesheets allows you to prepare all your invoices, both
.. i18n: expenses and timesheets for a project's customer.
..

根据时间表开票你可以准备好所有的发票，包括费用以及项目客户的时间表。

.. i18n: You can view the statistical analysis of expenses using menu :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Reporting --> Expenses Analysis`.
..

你可以通过 :menuselection:`人力资源 --> 报告 --> 费用分析` :menuselection:`Human Resources --> Reporting --> Expenses Analysis` 查看到费用统计分析。
