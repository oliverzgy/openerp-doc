优化 采购/销售 业务流程
===============================

.. i18n: To familiarize yourself with the system workflow, you will test a purchase-sale workflow in two phases.
..

为了熟悉业务流程,下面我们以采购与销售两个业务做样例.

.. i18n: The first consists of product purchase, which requires the following operations:
..

首先是采购业务,我们要达成下面的目的:

.. i18n: 	#. Place a purchase order with Plumbing Component Suppliers for 10 Titanium Alloy Radiators at a
.. i18n: 	   unit price of 56.00.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. Receive these products at your Goods In.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. Generate a purchase invoice.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. Pay your supplier.
..

	#. 从 元件供应商 那里以单价 56.00 采购 10 个 :guilabel:`钛合金散热器` .

	#. 做采购收货入库操作.

	#. 做供应商采购发票.

	#. 支付该发票.

.. i18n: Following this, you will sell some of these products, using this sequence:
..

然后,我们再做销售业务,以下面的数据为样例: 

.. i18n: 	#. Receive a sales order for 6 Titanium Alloy Radiators from Smith and Sons, sold at a unit price
.. i18n: 	   of 130.00.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. Dispatch the products.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. Invoice the customer.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. Receive the payment.
..

	#. 向 :guilabel:`客户` Smith and Sons 以单价 130.00/个 销售 6 个 :guilabel:`钛合金散热器` .

	#. 安排发货送货.

	#. 开据客户发票.

	#. 并做客户收款.

采购
--------------

.. i18n: To place a Purchase Order with your supplier, use the menu :menuselection:`Purchases --> Purchase Management -->
.. i18n: Purchase Orders` and click the `New` button.
..

要给供应商下达采购任务,菜单入口在 :menuselection:`Purchases --> Purchase Management --> Purchase Orders` 中文菜单项为 :menuselection:`采购 --> 采购管理 --> 采购订单`
点击 :guilabel:`新建` 按钮即可。

.. i18n: Complete the following field:
..

并填写采购订单中下面的字段:

.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Supplier` : \ ``Plumbing Component Suppliers``\  .
..

*  :guilabel:`Supplier` : \ ``Plumbing Component Suppliers``\  .

.. i18n: As you complete the :guilabel:`Supplier` field, OpenERP automatically completes the
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Address` field and the :guilabel:`Pricelist` field from information it takes out of the
.. i18n: Partner record.
..

当你选择了 :guilabel:`供应商` 后, 采购订单会自动完成该供应商的 :guilabel:`地址` 及 :guilabel:`价格表` 字段。

.. i18n: Enter the following information
..

录入下面的数据:

.. i18n: *  :guilabel:`Product` : \ ``Titanium Alloy Radiator``\   - type in part of this name then
.. i18n:    press the tab key to complete it, or click the
.. i18n:    :guilabel:`Search` icon at the end of the line to bring a search box. (if product is previously configured)
..

*  :guilabel:`产品` : \ ``钛合金散热器``\   - 在这里你可以按输入进行产品的模糊查询,当你输入一些产品名称关键词后按 ``Tab`` 键或者点击右侧的 :guilabel:`放大镜` 图标, 就会按给定的关键词弹出相关的产品查询结果窗口,供选择产品(前提是你已录入过相关产品的基础物料数据), 另外,如果你提供的查询只有一个结果时,系统会自动替你选择( ``Tab`` 键录入方式)。

.. i18n: When you have selected a product on the product line, OpenERP automatically completes the following
.. i18n: fields from information it finds in the Product record:
..

当你在采购明细行选择一个产品后，OpenERP会自动将该产品的其他下面的信息带出来:

.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Product UOM` : the unit of measure for this product,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Description` : the detailed description of the product,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` : based on the product lead time,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Unit Price` : the unit price of the product,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Analytic account` : if any account is specified then it will appear on the order line (it is not in this example),
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Taxes` : applicable taxes defined in the partner, if specified, otherwise in the
.. i18n:   product, if specified (there are not any in this example).
..

* :guilabel:`单位` : 产品的默认采购单位,

* :guilabel:`名称` : 产品的描述性名称,

* :guilabel:`交货日期` : 采购预计交付时间,

* :guilabel:`单价` : 产品的价格规则产生的默认采购价格,

* :guilabel:`辅助核算项` : 当你设置了辅助核算默认项值，会自动带出来。(本例没有设置相关辅助核算),

* :guilabel:`税` : applicable taxes defined in the partner, if specified, otherwise in the
  product, if specified (there are not any in this example).

.. i18n: You can edit any of these fields to suit the requirements of the purchase order at the time of
.. i18n: entry. Change the:
..

按上面的需求,修改采购订单中的数量及价格字段:

.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Quantity` : \ ``10``\ ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Unit Price` to \ ``56.00``\ .
..

* :guilabel:`数量` : \ ``10.00``\ .

* :guilabel:`价格` : \ ``56.00``\ .

.. i18n: Save the order line and close the :guilabel:`Order Line` window by clicking the
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Close` button. You can then confirm the whole one-line order by clicking
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Save`, which makes the form non-editable.
..

保存采购订单明细,点击 :guilabel:`关闭` 按钮关闭 :guilabel:`明细` 窗口. 点 :guilabel:`保存` 按钮, 可以保存数据并查看明细数据而不关闭窗口.

.. i18n: It is now in a state of \ ``Request for
.. i18n: Quotation``\ , so click :guilabel:`Convert to Purchase Order`, which corresponds to an approval from
.. i18n: a manager or from Accounts within your own company and moves the order into \ ``Approved`` \
.. i18n: state.
..

目前为止采购还仅是\ ``询价状态``\ ,现在你可以使用 \ ``采购经理``\ 或者 \ ``公司财务``\ 的角色 进到本采购单 点击 :guilabel:`转换为采购单` 的按钮, 批准该笔采购.

.. i18n: If you click the :guilabel:`Delivery & Invoicing` tab
.. i18n: you will see the delivery :guilabel:`Destination` is your own company's ``Stock`` location and that
.. i18n: the invoice was created from the order.
.. i18n: It is not entirely obvious at this stage, but the invoice is in a draft state so it can be
.. i18n: edited and, crucially, has no accounting impact yet: it is just ready for your accounting
.. i18n: group to activate it.
..

现在你点击 :guilabel:`收货与发票` 页签时，你可以看到收货地址是你所在公司 ``仓库`` 的 :guilabel:`收货地址` 。
并且系统已经自动为本次采购生成了草稿状态(还可以根据需要进行修改)的供应商发票。
因为目前为止还没有涉及财务部分，所以这个留到后面财务人员进行确认核准操作。

.. i18n: Receiving Goods

收货

.. i18n: After confirming the order, you would wait for the delivery of the products from your supplier. Typically

..

在确认采购后,就需要等供应商送货,并按下面的操作进行收货操作:

.. i18n: 	#. Open the menu :menuselection:`Warehouse --> Warehouse Management --> Incoming Shipments` using the expand/collapse icon.
..

	#. 点开各个菜单项前的展开图标 :menuselection:`仓库 --> 仓库管理 --> 收货` .

.. i18n: 	   .. note:: From the Purchase Order
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	      You could have clicked the :guilabel:`Receptions` link to the right of the Purchase Order
.. i18n: 	      to reach the same screen, but this would confuse the purchasing role with the
.. i18n: 	      stores role. That link is very useful during testing and training, however.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. When the :guilabel:`Incoming Shipments` window appears, select the name of the entry in the list
.. i18n: 	   (\ ``IN/00002``\)   to display the Packing List itself – you would usually do a search for the supplier name
.. i18n: 	   or order number in a list that was larger than this – then click :guilabel:`Process` to load the
.. i18n: 	   :guilabel:`Process Document` form.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	#. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to indicate that you are receiving the whole quantity of 10 units.
..

	   .. note:: From the Purchase Order

	      You could have clicked the :guilabel:`Receptions` link to the right of the Purchase Order
	      to reach the same screen, but this would confuse the purchasing role with the
	      stores role. That link is very useful during testing and training, however.

	#. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to indicate that you are receiving the whole quantity of 10 units.

.. i18n: At this point you have accepted 10 units into your company, in a location that you have already seen.
..

当你收货确认这一刻,你应该可以在对应库存查询到公司该产品的相应库存量了. 恭喜恭喜...

.. i18n: Using the menu :menuselection:`Purchases --> Products --> Products` you can find the product `Titanium Alloy Radiators`
.. i18n: with `Real Stock` and `Virtual Stock` 10. From the product form click on the link at the right most side `Stock by Location`,
.. i18n: you can see the `Real Stock` and `Virtual Stock` of this product in various locations. Now click on the `Location Inventory Overview`
.. i18n: report to see the inventory valuation per location.
..

使用菜单 :menuselection:`采购 --> 产品 --> 产品` 你可以找到产品 :guilabel:`钛合金散热器` 实物库存和虚拟库存数量为10.0了。 单击该产品进入到产品 :guilabel:`表单` 页后,在右面最右侧的 :guilabel:`按库位查看库存` 链接可以直接查看该产品在各个物理库位与虚拟库位的数量分布情况。点击 :guilabel:`库位库存概要` 报表就可以查看到各库位各产品的详细库存情况。

..

开票管理
--------

.. i18n: When you have received an invoice from your supplier (which would usually be sent to your Accounts department),
.. i18n: go to the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices`
.. i18n: to open a list of supplier invoices waiting for receipt.
.. i18n: These invoices enable your Accounts Department to match the price and quantities
.. i18n: ordered against the price and quantities on the supplier's invoice (and since it is not uncommon to receive
.. i18n: an invoice showing details more favourable to the supplier than those agreed at the time of
.. i18n: purchase, this is a useful function).
..

When you have received an invoice from your supplier (which would usually be sent to your Accounts department),
go to the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices`
to open a list of supplier invoices waiting for receipt.
These invoices enable your Accounts Department to match the price and quantities
ordered against the price and quantities on the supplier's invoice (and since it is not uncommon to receive
an invoice showing details more favourable to the supplier than those agreed at the time of
purchase, this is a useful function).

.. i18n: In this example, you created an invoice automatically when you confirmed the supplier's Purchase
.. i18n: Order. That is because the :guilabel:`Invoicing Control`  field on the order was set to \ ``From
.. i18n: Order``\ (the default option). Other options enable you to create invoices at the time of
.. i18n: receiving goods or manually. The initial state of an invoice is \ ``Draft``\  .

In this example, you created an invoice automatically when you confirmed the supplier's Purchase
Order. That is because the :guilabel:`Invoicing Control`  field on the order was set to \ ``From
Order``\ (the default option). Other options enable you to create invoices at the time of
receiving goods or manually. The initial state of an invoice is \ ``Draft``\  .

.. i18n: Now click the invoice for your order \ ``PO00001``\  to display its contents. You can compare the
.. i18n: goods that you have recorded there with the invoice received from your supplier. If there is a
.. i18n: difference, it is possible to change the order lines to, for example, add a delivery charge. Click
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Validate` to confirm the invoice and put it into the \ ``Open`` \   state.
..

Now click the invoice for your order \ ``PO00001``\  to display its contents. You can compare the
goods that you have recorded there with the invoice received from your supplier. If there is a
difference, it is possible to change the order lines to, for example, add a delivery charge. Click
:guilabel:`Validate` to confirm the invoice and put it into the \ ``Open`` \   state.

.. i18n: Accounting entries are generated automatically once the invoice is validated. To see the effects on
.. i18n: your chart of accounts, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Charts --> Chart of
.. i18n: Accounts` ,then click :guilabel:`Open Charts` at the :guilabel:`Chart of Accounts` page to see that you
.. i18n: have a debit of ``560.00`` in the ``Purchases`` account and a credit of ``560.00`` in
.. i18n: the ``Payable`` account.
..

当发票核准时,系统会自动生成对应的会计凭证.这时打开 公司的会计科目一览表( :menuselection:`会计 --> 表 --> 科目一览表` ,
在 :guilabel:`科目一览表` 窗体中 点击 :guilabel:`打开一览表` 按钮, 
你就可以看到对应的 ``材料采购`` 科目借方余额与 ``应付帐款`` 科目贷方余额 为 ``560.00`` 元.

..

支付货款
-------------------

.. i18n: Select the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices` and click on the :guilabel:`Unpaid` button
.. i18n: for a list of supplier invoices that have not yet been paid. Write the
.. i18n: ``PO00001`` in  `Source Document` text itself to find the invoice.
.. i18n: In practice, you would search for the invoice by order number or,
.. i18n: more generally, for invoices nearing their payment date.
..

选择菜单 :menuselection:`Accounting --> Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices` and click on the :guilabel:`Unpaid` button
for a list of supplier invoices that have not yet been paid. 写PO00001在源文档文本本身发现发票。在实践中,你将会寻找发票通过订单号,或更普遍而言,他们的付款日期为发票接近。

.. i18n: Click on :guilabel:`Pay Invoice` button in the supplier invoice form. It opens the
.. i18n: :guilabel:`Pay Invoice` window in new tab with a description of the payment.
..

在打开的供应商发票页面点击 :guilabel:`支付发票` 按钮, 打开 :guilabel:`发票支付` 窗体进行发票支付操作.

.. i18n: ``Supplier`` and ``Date`` comes automatically from invoice. You need to just enter the
.. i18n: ``Payment Method``.  After that, click on :guilabel:`Validate` button to post this entry.
..

``供应商`` 与 ``日期`` 会自动从发票获取. 你只需要选择 ``支付方式`` 并点击 :guilabel:`核准` 按钮即可.
