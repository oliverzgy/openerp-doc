.. i18n: One of the new features of OpenERP is the :guilabel:`Configuration` wizard. Once run, the :guilabel:`Reconfigure` shortcut will appear. This wizard provides an easy way to install modules, thanks to its user-friendly and easy-to-use interface. The user may invoke this wizard at his own convenience using the shortcut :guilabel:`Reconfigure`, found just below the database and user name in the web interface or in the Shortcut menu in the GTK client. The same Configuration dialog box appears that you may have encountered at the time of installing a new database. Why did we call it the :guilabel:`Reconfigure` wizard? Indeed, because it allows the user to review installed applications and install related additional features or simply to install new applications on the fly.

.. i18n: Install extra applications simply by checking the corresponding options and clicking :guilabel:`Install` or click :guilabel:`Skip` to stop the configuration. You will eventually also come across the :guilabel:`CRM Application Configuration` step which you may use to add features to your CRM application. For now, select the \ ``Claims`` \ option and click :guilabel:`Configure`. This will in turn install the :mod:`crm_claim` module.
