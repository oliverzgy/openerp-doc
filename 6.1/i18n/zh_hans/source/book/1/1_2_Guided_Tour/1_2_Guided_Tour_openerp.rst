.. i18n: Accounting is totally integrated into all of the company's functions, whether it is general,

.. i18n: Accounting that is integrated throughout all of the company's processes greatly simplifies the work

.. i18n: So OpenERP's accounting is not just for financial reporting – it is also the anchor-point for many
.. i18n: of the company's management processes. For example, if one of your accountants puts a customer on
