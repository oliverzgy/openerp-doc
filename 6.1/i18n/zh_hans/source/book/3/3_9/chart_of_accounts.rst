.. i18n: When configuring the software, OpenERP allows you to choose predefined charts of accounts, which include all basic configuration, such as tax codes and fiscal positions. Of course, you can also define your own chart of accounts.
..

配置软件时，OpenERP允许您选择预定义的会计科目表，其中包括所有的基本配置，如税收法规和财政状况。当然，你也可以定义自己的会计科目表。

.. i18n: Using a Preconfigured Chart of Accounts
.. i18n: ---------------------------------------
..

使用预配置的会计科目表
---------------------------------------

.. i18n: On installation, the software allows you to select a default chart of accounts from a huge list of predefined charts. To install the chart of accounts as well as the tax definitions for your own country (in most cases), select the chart corresponding to your country from the ``Installation Wizard``.
.. i18n: The ``Generic Chart of Accounts`` offers a default (but limited) set of accounts which can be used as a basic chart in any country. The ``Chart of Accounts`` list also includes a lot of localised charts of accounts.
..

在安装时，软件可以让您从许多的预定义好的科目表中选择一个默认的会计科目表。 要安装（大多数情况下）贵国的会计科目表以及税种定义，需从 ``Installation Wizard`` 中选择符合贵国的列表。 ``Generic Chart of Accounts`` 提供一个默认（但有限）的科目表，可作为任何国家科目表的基础。 ``Chart of Accounts`` 列表中还包括了很多本地化的会计科目表。

   *采用通用会计科目表*

.. i18n: The wizard will change a bit according to the chart of accounts you select. For the Generic Chart you will be able to add a tax percentage, which will not be the case when you install, for instance, the chart named ``Belgium - Plan Comptable Minimum Normalise``. Here OpenERP will automatically install the tax configuration for Belgium too. You will, however, be able to select the default sales and purchase tax to be added when you create a new product.
..

该向导将根据您所选择的科目表而有所不同。 For the Generic Chart you will be able to add a tax percentage, which will not be the case when you install, for instance, the chart named ``Belgium - Plan Comptable Minimum Normalise``. 这里的OpenERP也会自动安装比利时税务定义。您也许希望，当增加一个新的产品时可以选择默认的销售和采购税种。

   *采用比利时科目表*

.. i18n: Please keep in mind that even when you use a default chart of accounts, you can still modify it to fit your needs.
..

请记住，即使您使用默认的会计科目表，您仍然可以修改它以满足您的需求。

.. i18n: .. note:: Modules
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     You can install a chart from the list of modules too, so simply skip the installation wizard then. The module name will be like :mod:`l10n_XX` where XX represents your country code in two letters. For example, to get the chart of accounts for Belgium, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Modules --> Modules` and install the module :mod:`l10n_be`. This will propose the exact same chart from the wizard (``Belgium - Plan Comptable Minimum Normalise``).
..

.. note:: 模块

    您也可以从模块列表中安装一个科目表，要这样在此只需要简单地跳过安装向导。 模块名会类似 :mod:`l10n_XX` ，这里 XX 是表示国家代码的两个字母。 例如,要得到比利时科目表, 通过 :menuselection:`Settings --> Modules --> Modules` 安装模块 :mod:`l10n_be`。 结果和通过向导 (``Belgium - Plan Comptable Minimum Normalise``) 可取得同样的科目表。

.. i18n: Some of these pre-defined charts of accounts are comprehensive and accurate, others rather have a more tentative status and are simply indicators of the possibilities. You can modify these, or build your own accounts onto the default chart, or replace it entirely with a custom chart.
..

许多预定义的科目表是完整且准确的，但也有一些处于试验状态和仅仅显示其可能性如此定义。 您可以修改它们，或在默认科目表上定义自己的科目， 或根据自定义的科目表修改其中项目。

.. tip:: Virtual Accounts

        Virtual accounts enable you to provide different representations of one or several existing charts of accounts.
        Creating and restructuring virtual accounts has no impact on the accounting entries.
        You can then use the virtual charts with no risk of altering the general chart of accounts or future accounting entries.

        Because they are used only to get a different representation of the same entries, they are very useful for:

        * consolidating several companies in real time,

        * reporting to a holding according to their chart of accounts,

        * depreciation calculations,

        * cash-flow views,

        * getting more useful views than those imposed,

        * presenting summary charts to other users that are appropriate to their general system rights.

        So there are good reasons for viewing the impact of financial transactions through virtual charts, such as budgets and financial indicators based on special views of the company.

.. i18n: To create a new chart of accounts you should create a root account using the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Financial Accounting --> Accounts --> Accounts`. Your top level account should have a name, a code (different from any other code in your current chart), an :guilabel:`Internal Type` and :guilabel:`Account Type`  \ ``View``\. Then you can choose your structure by creating other accounts of :guilabel:`Account Type` \ ``View``\ as necessary. The :guilabel:`Internal Type` should be of the ``Consolidation`` type if you want to map accounts. Check your virtual structure using the menu :menuselection:`Financial Management --> Charts --> Charts of Accounts` and select the corresponding chart in the drop-down list at the top of the screen.

If you add a ``View`` account to the consolidated children, OpenERP will automatically include all existing and future linked accounts.
