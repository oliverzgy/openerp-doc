.. i18n: At the end of a financial year, you will have to transfer the closing balance of that year as an opening balance to the new financial year. OpenERP allows you to automatically post such an entry. You can transfer the new opening balance numerous times, because it is impossible to close a year at once. Correction entries will have to be made, due to which balances will change. The new balance can easily be transferred through a wizard, so you do not have to keep track of each correction entry made in the previous financial year.
