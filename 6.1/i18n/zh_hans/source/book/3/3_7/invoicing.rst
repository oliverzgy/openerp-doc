发票 
========

.. i18n: In OpenERP, the concept of “invoice” includes the following documents:
..

OpenERP中, 发票管理包含以下部分:

.. i18n: * The Customer Invoice
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * The Supplier Invoice
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A Customer Credit Note or Customer Refund
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A Supplier Credit Note or Supplier Refund
..

* 客户发票

* 供应商发票

* 客户红字发票

* 供应商红字发票

.. i18n: Only the invoice type and the representation mode differ for each of the four documents. But they are
.. i18n: all stored in the same object type in the system.
..

这四类发票在系统是中同一对象, 仅仅只是发票类型与界面展现方式不一样.

.. i18n: You get the correct form for each of the four types of invoice from the menu you use to open it. The
.. i18n: name of the tab enables you to tell the invoice types apart when you are working on them.
..

OpenERP 为这四种类型的发票对应设置了四个菜单项,不同的菜单项会打开对应的发票表单, 从表单名就可以区分开.

.. i18n: .. index::
.. i18n:    single: invoices; types

.. i18n: .. note::  Types of Invoice
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         There are many advantages in deriving the different types of invoice from the same object. Two of the
.. i18n:         most important are:
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         * In a multi-company environment with inter-company invoicing, a customer invoice in one company
.. i18n:           becomes a supplier invoice for the other,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         * This enables you to work and search for all invoices from the same menu. If you are looking for an
.. i18n:           invoicing history, OpenERP provides both supplier and customer invoices in the same list, as well
.. i18n:           as credit notes.
..

.. note::  发票类型

        多类型发票使用同一对象有很多方便之处,典型的优势如以下两点:

        * 多公司环境时公司间的发票,一个公司的客户发票则转为另一个公司的供应商发票.

        * 在同一个界面下, 你可以检索和处理各种类型的发票.在处理合作伙伴的应收/付帐时,你可以很清楚在这个列表中列出.

.. i18n:    A credit note is a document that enables you to cancel an invoice or part of an invoice.
..

.. note:: Credit Note

   A credit note is a document that enables you to cancel an invoice or part of an invoice.

.. i18n: To access customer invoices in OpenERP, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting -->
.. i18n: Customers --> Customer Invoices`, and for supplier invoices, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting -->
.. i18n: Suppliers --> Supplier Invoices`.
..

点击菜单 :menuselection:`会计(Accounting) --> 客户(Customers) --> 客户发票(Customer Invoices)` 进入客户发票列表.
点击菜单 :menuselection:`会计(Accounting) --> 供应商(Suppliers) --> 供应商发票(Supplier Invoices)` 进入供应商发票列表.

.. i18n: Most of the time, invoices are generated automatically by OpenERP as they are generated from other
.. i18n: processes in the system. So it is not usually necessary to create them manually, but simply approve
.. i18n: or validate them. OpenERP uses the following different ways of generating invoices:
..

通常情况,OpenERP中的发票都是由业务系统自动生成出来的.所以,一般不需要手工创建发票,只需要轻轻一点确认或审核即可.
OpenERP中一般有下面的几种途径去生成发票:

.. i18n: * from Supplier or Customer Orders,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * from receipt or dispatch of goods,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * from work carried out (timesheets, see :ref:`ch-hr`),
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * from closed tasks (see :ref:`ch-projects`),
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * from fee charges or other rechargeable expenses (see :ref:`ch-services`).
..

* 来自供应商与客户的订单,

* from receipt or dispatch of goods,

* 来自员工工单(timesheets, 参阅 :ref:`ch-hr`),

* 来自完成的项目工作 (参阅 :ref:`ch-projects`),

* from fee charges or other rechargeable expenses (see :ref:`ch-services`).

.. i18n: The different processes generate \ ``Draft``\   invoices. These must then be approved by a suitable
.. i18n: system user and sent to the customer. The different invoicing methods are detailed in the following
.. i18n: sections and chapters.

.. i18n: It is also possible to enter invoices manually. This is usually done for invoices that are not
.. i18n: associated with an order (usually purchase orders) or Credit Notes. Also, if the system has not been
.. i18n: configured correctly you might need to edit the invoice before sending it to the customer.

.. i18n: Entering a Customer Invoice
.. i18n: ---------------------------
..

录入客户发票
---------------------------

.. i18n: The principle of entering data for invoices in OpenERP is very simple, as it enables non-
.. i18n: accountant users to create their own invoices. This means that your accounting information can be
.. i18n: kept up-to-date all the time as orders are placed and received, and their taxes are calculated.
..

OpenERP 的发票录入相当方便,而且支持非财务人员录入相应的发票信息.这意味着发票在生成到收款期间,随时可以保证
发票数据及相应税额计算的更新.

.. i18n: At the same time, it allows people who have more accounting knowledge to keep full control over the
.. i18n: accounting entries that are being generated. Each value proposed by OpenERP can be modified later
.. i18n: if needed.
..

同时,具有会计权限的员工可以完成后续的凭证分录的处理.并且分录中的数据还可以继续修改确认.

.. i18n: Start by manually entering a customer invoice. Use :menuselection:`Accounting -->
.. i18n: Customers --> Customer Invoices` and click on `New` button for this.
..

点击菜单 :menuselection:`会计(Accounting) --> 客户(Customers) --> 客户发票(Customer Invoices)` 进入客户发票列表, 再点击 `新建(New)` 按钮
即可创建一张新的客户发票.

.. i18n: A new invoice form opens for entering information.
..

在新打开的发票窗体中,输入下面的信息.

.. i18n: .. figure::  images/account_invoice_new.png
.. i18n:    :scale: 75
.. i18n:    :align: center

.. i18n:    *Entering a New Invoice*
..

.. figure::  images/account_invoice_new.png
   :scale: 75
   :align: center

   *输入新发票*

.. i18n: The document is composed of three parts:
..

发票包含以下三部分:

.. i18n: * the top of the invoice, with customer information,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the bottom of the page, with detail about the taxes, and the totals.
..

* 发票的抬头,是客户相关信息,

* 发票主体部分,则是发票的明细行,

* 发票的下面部分,则是关于所缴税行明细以及发票的汇总.

.. i18n: To enter a document in OpenERP, you should always fill in fields in the order they appear on
.. i18n: screen. Doing it this way means that some of the later fields are filled in automatically from the
.. i18n: selections made in earlier fields. So select the `Customer`, and the following fields are
.. i18n: completed automatically:
..

在填写发票信息的时候,你最好按OpenERP表单上的顺序填定数据.这样的目的是为了让你在录入一些数据后,能自动带出
其他字段的值.如,你选择一个客户后,下面的这些字段会被自动带出来:

.. i18n: * the invoice address corresponds to the customer contact that was given the address type of
.. i18n:   `Invoice` in the partner form (or otherwise the address type of `Default`),
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the partner account corresponds to the account given in the `Accounting` which is found in a
.. i18n:   tab of the partner form,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * a specific or a default payment condition can be defined for this partner in the
.. i18n:   `Accounting` tab of the partner form. Payment conditions are generated by rules for the payment of
.. i18n:   the invoice. For example: 50% in 21 days and 50% in 60 days from the end of the month.
..

* 发票地址 默认使用了该客户联系人的发票地址,如果没有发票地址,则使用该客户联系人的默认地址,

* 客户应收账款科目 默认使用了该客户窗体中 `会计` 页签中的 `应收账款` 科目,

* a specific or a default payment condition can be defined for this partner in the
  `Accounting` tab of the partner form. Payment conditions are generated by rules for the payment of
  the invoice. For example: 50% in 21 days and 50% in 60 days from the end of the month.

.. i18n: .. note:: Properties Fields
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         The Properties fields on the Partner form or the Product form are multi-company fields. The value
.. i18n:         that the user sees in these fields depends on the company that the user works for.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         If you work in a multi-company environment that is using one database, you have several charts of
.. i18n:         accounts. Asset and liability accounts for a partner depend on the company that the user works for.
..

.. note:: Properties 字段

        ``合作伙伴`` 或者 ``产品`` 上的 `Property` 字段是多公司类型的. 该字段的值取决于当前用户所属公司.

        在一个账套上使用多公司配置,你可能需要为每个公司配置财务报表. 而且合作伙伴的 `资产` 与 `负债` 科目是也按公司分开的.

.. i18n: .. tip:: Seeing Partner Relationships
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    You can reach more information from certain relation fields in OpenERP.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * In the web client in read-only mode, a relation is commonly a hyperlink
.. i18n:      - it takes you to the main form for that entity, with all of the actions and links.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * In the web client in edit mode you can right-click in the field to get a
.. i18n:      context menu with links and other options.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * And in the GTK client you can right-click the field to get that same
.. i18n:      context menu.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    So one way or another you can rapidly reach the partner's:
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * current sales and purchases,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * CRM requests,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * open invoices,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * accounts records,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:    * payable and receivable accounts.

   * 应收/应付科目.

.. i18n: You can add more detailed additional information to the invoice and select the currency that you want to invoice in.
..

录入发票其他相关内容并选择适当的发票币种.

.. i18n: Once the invoice heading is saved, you must enter the different invoice lines. You could use either
.. i18n: of the two techniques:
..

发票表头输入完成后, 输入表体部分时, 你可以用下面两种方式来输入:

.. i18n: * enter the whole field manually,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * use a product to complete the different fields automatically.
..

* 表体各字段手工输入,

* 选择一个产品, 让产品相关数据自动完成相关字段的输入.

.. i18n: .. tip:: Invoice Line Description
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         The invoice line description is more of a title than a comment. If you want to add more detailed
.. i18n:         comments you can use the field in the second tab `Notes`.
..

.. tip:: 发票明细备注

        发票明细备注是对于明细摘要的补充.如果你对于发票明细添加更多的说明时,你只需要在明细窗体中的 `备注(notes)` 
        字段中输入即可.

.. i18n: So select the product \ ``Basic PC`` \ in the product field in an invoice line. The
.. i18n: following fields are then completed automatically:
