良好的预算管理
-------------------------

.. i18n: Budgets are important for a company to get a good grip on forecasted expenses and revenues. They allow you to measure your actual financial performance against the planned one.
..

对于公司来说，预算是非常重要的，使你能很好地控制并预计费用和收入。他们使你能衡量财务状况相对于计划的实际表现。

.. i18n: OpenERP manages its budgets using both General and Analytic Accounts.
.. i18n: Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Modules --> Modules` and install :mod:`account_budget` to be able to do this.
..

OpenERP 使用总账和辅助核算来管理预算
进入菜单 :menuselection:`设置Settings --> 模块Modules --> 模块Modules` 并安装模块 :mod:`account_budget` 就可以做这些工作了.

.. i18n: The first step in defining budgets is to determine the general accounts for which you want to keep budgets (typically expense or income accounts).
.. i18n: That is what you will use ``Budgetary Positions`` for, from the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Budgets --> Budgetary Positions`. Here you can select the general accounts for which you want to keep budgets. The aim is to group general accounts logically, according to sales or purchases, for instance. OpenERP has no limitations as to the account types that can be used for budgeting.

要开始预算, 点击菜单 :menuselection:`会计(Accounting) --> 预算(Budgets) --> 预算(Budgets)`, 点击 `新建(New)` 按钮可以创建一张预算单据.

.. i18n: .. tip:: Budget Revisions
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     Even though you *can* modify a budget at any time to make a revision, we recommend you to create a new budget, because otherwise you will have no history of changes.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:     Rather than edit an existing budget, make a new version so that you can keep your original estimates safe for comparison. This lets you analyse your changing perspectives of the company from revision to revision.
..

.. tip:: 预算的版本管理

    虽然你 *可以* 在任何时间进行预算的修改,但我们还是推荐只是做创建一个新的预算,这样才可以很明了地看到预算的整个修改历史.

    Rather than edit an existing budget, make a new version so that you can keep your original estimates safe for comparison. This lets you analyse your changing perspectives of the company from revision to revision.

.. i18n: To define your budgets, start by entering a :guilabel:`Name`, a :guilabel:`Code`, a :guilabel:`Start Date` and an :guilabel:`End Date` for your new budget. Then you can define the budgeted amounts for each analytic account within a specified period, one by one (enter negative amounts for purchases, positive amounts for sales). For each, you define:
..

创建一张预算单后,输入 :guilabel:`摘要(Name)`, :guilabel:`编码(Code)`, :guilabel:`起始日期(Start Date)`, :guilabel:`终止日期(End Date)` . 然后将你要纳入预算管理的某个会计期间的辅助核算科目及预算金额全部一条条地填写进去(注意: 采购类的需要输入一个负数金额):

.. i18n: * an :guilabel:`Analytic Account`
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * a :guilabel:`Budgetary Position`, for example ``Sales`` or ``Purchases``,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * a :guilabel:`Start Date` and an :guilabel:`End Date` for the budget,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * a :guilabel:`Planned Amount` in the default currency of the chart of accounts.

* a :guilabel:`Budgetary Position`, for example ``Sales`` or ``Purchases``,

* a :guilabel:`Start Date` and an :guilabel:`End Date` for the budget,

* a :guilabel:`Planned Amount` in the default currency of the chart of accounts.

.. i18n: Once this information is completed, save your budget.
..

上述信息完成后, 保存该预算单.

.. i18n: A budget has various stages:
..

预算各阶段的流程:

.. i18n: * *Confirmed*: the budget is to be reviewed, but it can still be changed before actual approval;
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * *Approved*: the budget is approved by the budget holder; the name of the user approving the budget will be displayed in the ``Validate User`` field.
..

* *确认(Confirmed)*: 表示预算已审核通过,但还是可以随时进行预算修改.

* *Approved*: the budget is approved by the budget holder; the name of the user approving the budget will be displayed in the ``Validate User`` field.

.. i18n: You can cancel a budget and reset it to draft for the two preceding steps.
..

如果觉得不合适,你随时可以在前面两种状态下, `取消(Cancel)` 该预算单后再将其 `置为草稿`.

.. i18n: * *Done*: the budget is fully approved and no changes will be allowed. You can no longer cancel the budget and reset it to draft.
..

* *完成(Done)*: 完成状态的预算单就不允许再做任何修改了. 而且也不能再取消后置为草稿了.

.. i18n: The :guilabel:`Theoretical Amount` indicates the actual amount that might have been realised for the budget concerned according to the current date. When your budget is 1200 for 12 months, and today is the 30 October, the theoretical amount will be 1000, since this is the actual amount that could have been realised to date.

.. i18n: To print a budget and make calculations of expenditure through budget, use the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Budgets --> Budgets`. OpenERP then gives you a list of available budgets. Select one or more budgets and then click :guilabel:`Print Budgets` to create the report for each, in a date range of your choice.

.. i18n: The ``Print Budget`` report gives an overview of each analytic account included in your budget, according to the individual budgetary positions for that account. From the percentage and the comparison of planned (budgeted) and practical (actual) amounts, you have a good view on your situation.

.. i18n: Each of these reports can be printed from a specific date to a specific date. The End Date selected in the wizard determines how the theoretical amount will be calculated; if you select the last day of your financial year, the theoretical amount will be calculated as a function of that date (thus considering a complete financial year). Note that the theoretical amount will be zero when the :guilabel:`Paid Date` entered is equal to or greater than the :guilabel:`End Date` for the budget.

.. i18n: The percentage for a budget is calculated as follows: (practical amount / theoretical amount) x 100.
.. i18n: This way you get a view on how much of the forecasted amount has been actually realised in your accounting.
