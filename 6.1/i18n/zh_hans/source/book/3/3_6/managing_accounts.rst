The start date will determine which documents will be included in the report (document date until the selected start date) and it will serve as a reference date to calculate the amounts due for the selected interval.

The analysis direction may be ``Past`` (for entries that are due) or ``Future`` to keep track of your cash flow in the next days or weeks (according to your selection). OpenERP then calculates a table of credit balance by period. So, if you request an interval of 30 days, OpenERP generates an analysis of creditors for the past month, past two months, and so on.

To look up statistic information about your accounting, explore the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Statistic Reports`. There you will find ``Invoices Analysis``, ``Entries Analysis`` and ``Treasury Analysis`` to name some. By default these statistics are displayed as a list which you can filter to fit your needs. Standard filter buttons, extended filters and grouping features allow you to make an in-depth analysis of your accounting. But the list is not all OpenERP has to offer. These statistic reports can be displayed as a graph simply by clicking the ``Graph`` button at the top right side of the screen. Notice that graphs allow for only one Group by function at a time.
