   *开票流程*

.. i18n: An invoice can be generated from various documents, such as a `Sales Order` and a `Purchase Order`, or at the time of confirming a shipment. These methods will be proposed when you use OpenERP as a truely integrated system.
..

发票可根据其他各种文件生成，如销售订单，采购订单，或在确认发货时间时生成。 当您的OpenERP是一真正的集成系统时将提供这些方法.

.. i18n: Of course, companies often work together with an external accountant who keeps their books. In that case, you would like to know which invoices exist and have been paid.
..

当然，企业通常与记录这些信息的会计师一起工作。在这种情况下，您想知道哪些发票已经开出，并已支付。

.. i18n: The specific and easy-to-use `Invoicing` system in OpenERP allows you to keep track of your accounting, even when you are not an accountant.
.. i18n: It provides an easy way to follow up your suppliers and customers. You could use this simplified accounting in case you work with an (external) account to keep your books, and you still want to keep track of payments. The ``Invoicing`` system includes receipts and vouchers (an easy way to keep track of sales and purchases). It also offers you an easy method to register payments, without you having to encode complete abstracts of account.
..

.. i18n: Sales Receipts are merely a kind of sales ticket and not a real invoice.
..

您你卖产品给客户时，您可以给他一个真正的发票或销售收据，这也被称为客户收据。销售收据仅仅是一种销售小票，而不是一个真正的发票。

.. i18n: When the sales receipt is confirmed, OpenERP creates journal items automatically and you can record the customer payment related to this sales receipt. The easy invoicing system does not require extensive accounting setup, so you will be up and running quickly!
..

当销售收据确认后，OpenERP的自动创建销售记录，并记录客户有关这张收据的付款情况。 简单的发票系统并不需要做大量的会计配置，因此您能很快上线并快速使用!

.. i18n: You can create and modify a sales receipt from the menu :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Sales Receipt`.

.. i18n: When you create a new `Sales Receipt`, you have to enter the `Customer` for whom you want to create a voucher. You can also define `Sales Lines` in the `Sales Information` tab. Here you have to define `Account`, `Amount` and `Description`.
.. i18n: At the bottom of the form, you will have two options for `Payment`: one is `Pay Directly` and another is `Pay Later or Group Funds`.
.. i18n: When you select the `Pay Directly` option, you have to enter the bank `Account`. The `Total` amount displays automatically with calculation of tax (if you select VAT to be added) when you click the `Compute Tax` button.
..

在表单底部， 您有两个“支付”选项：一个是“直接支付”， 另一个是“稍后付款或集中付款“.
当您选择”立即付款“选项，您必须录入银行“帐户”. 当您点击”计算税“按钮后，”总金额“会自动包含计算的税款（如果您添加了增值税信息）.

.. i18n: When you purchase products from a supplier, you will receive a `Purchase Receipt` (a ticket),  which is also called `Notes Payable`
.. i18n: in accounting terminology. When a purchase receipt is confirmed, it creates journal items automatically and you can record

The trend is clearly for personal communication to disregard these legacy media, and replace them with instant messaging, social networks, etc. The *Electronic Data Interchange* (EDI) platform is here to try and open OpenERP to more modern communication systems, where electronic documents are exchanged and synchronised between business partners in real-time.
