To define leads, imagine a bucket full of potential sales contacts expressing an interest in your company's products. 

.. i18n: A lead represents a potential customer with whom you have not established a relationship yet. Usually a lead contains valuable information to realise future sales opportunities. However, the most common mistake is that such key information too often gets lost, because it is registered nowhere. And even when registered, it might still be difficult to track any activity for that lead, because the information is not at hand when you need it.

So when would you create a lead in OpenERP, either manually or automatically? The following events could be a trigger:

.. i18n: * An inquiry email sent to one of your company's generic email addresses, such as sales@mycompany.com, from the mailgateway,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A business card from a prospective customer met briefly at an exhibition: you have to contact him
.. i18n:   again to qualify the lead and to know if there is any possibility of a sales opportunity; registered manually,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A database of potential customers in a given sector and region imported through a CSV file. The potential customers have to be
.. i18n:   contacted again individually or through a mass mailing to determine which contacts require further follow-up,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * An interesting contact that you met during a business networking event. You have to qualify it before assigning a salesperson to the contact,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * A form completed on your website directly integrated into OpenERP using our webservice. Before converting the form
.. i18n:   into a sales proposition or opportunity, you should read and handle the person's request.

Of course, before converting a lead into an opportunity, some qualification work has to be done.

.. i18n: OpenERP allows you to easily configure the way your company qualifies leads. You can create your own stages through :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Leads & Opportunities --> Stages`. Use the sequence number to determine the order of the stages, i.e. 10 for First Call, 20 for Renewing Contact and so on. Of course, you can also drag & drop a stage to another place to automatically change the order of all the stages. A salesman can change the status of the lead according to the response from the prospect and enter the result of this contact in the lead form (e.g. in the ``Notes`` field).
