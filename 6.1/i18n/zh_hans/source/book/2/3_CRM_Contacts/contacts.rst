.. i18n: What is the difference between a partner and a contact in OpenERP? A ``Partner`` represents an entity that you do business with - a customer, a prospect, or even an employee of your company. In other CRM applications, a partner is also referred to as an Account.
.. i18n: A ``Contact`` represents a person who works for a partner.
..

在OPENERP中，合作伙伴和联系人之间有什么区别呢？ ``合作伙伴`` 代表一个与你有业务来往的个体 - 客户, 潜在客户, 甚至你公司的
员工.在其他CRM软件中, 合作伙伴也称为一个账户.
``联系人`` 则代表合作伙伴中的个人.

.. i18n: Each partner can have an unlimited number of contacts. OpenERP also allows you to have several contacts with the same address type for one partner. You can easily link several Invoice addresses to a customer, for instance. 
..

每个合作伙伴可以有无数个联系人. Openerp同样允许一个合作伙伴有多个相同地址类型的联系人.比如，你可以轻松地链接多个开票地址
给一个客户. 

.. i18n: .. note:: Address Types
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	If you have recorded several contacts for the same partner, you can tell OpenERP which contact will be used in
.. i18n: 	various documents (e.g. a quotation) by specifying the ``Address Type``.
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: 	For example, a partner (*company*) can have a delivery address that differs from the company's invoice address.
.. i18n: 	If the Address Types are correctly assigned, OpenERP can automatically select the appropriate address
.. i18n: 	during the creation of the document – an invoice is addressed to the contact that has been assigned
.. i18n: 	the Address Type of Invoice, otherwise to the Default address.
..

.. note::  地址类型

	如果你已经为相同的合作伙伴登记了多个联系人, 你能够通过指定 ``地址类型`` 告诉 OpenERP 用于哪种文档用哪个联系人（例如报价单）。
	

	例如：, 合作伙伴(*公司*) 可以有一个发运地址以区别于公司的开票地址.
	如果地址类型被正确指定, OpenERP 在创建单据的时候，能自动选择合适的地址 ---- 发票地址被指派为 地址类型为 `发票` ，
	否则是默认地址。

.. i18n: The concept of a partner in OpenERP is much more flexible than in many other management applications. Why is that? Because a partner can be your supplier and your customer at the same time.
.. i18n: As a consequence, any data you update for that partner will apply to both customer and supplier! Thanks to this, you no longer need to update your address book several times (or even in several places) for the same partner.
..

OpenERP中合作伙伴的概念要比许多其他管理应用程序灵活得多. 为什么呢？? 因为合作伙伴可以同时是你的供应商和客户。
因此，你更新的任何数据将同时应用于客户和供应商! 多亏了这个,你不再需要为同样的合作伙伴更新您的地址簿几次(甚至在几个地方)。

.. i18n: The partner form contains information about the company, such as its corporate name, its primary language, and whether the company is a
.. i18n: \ ``Customer`` \ and/or a \ ``Supplier`` \. The partner form is composed of several tabs.
..

合作伙伴表单包括了关于公司的信息, 比如公司名称，主要语言，公司是 ``客户`` \ 和/或 \ ``供应商`` \. 
合作伙伴的表单由几个标签组成.

.. i18n: * the :guilabel:`General` tab contains information about different contacts of that partner, postal information,
.. i18n:   communication information and the categories the partner belongs to,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the :guilabel:`Sales & Purchases` tab contains information such as the default salesman and sales team, and the website,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the :menuselection:`History` tab gives visibility on the complete ``Communication History`` (meetings, marketing campaign activities,
.. i18n:   leads and opportunities, phone calls, emails) with the partner. The events the partner has been involved in are created automatically by
.. i18n:   different documents like phone calls, leads, meetings,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * the :menuselection:`Notes` tab is an area for free text notes.
..

* :guilabel:`一般` 标签包括了合作伙伴不同联系人的信息, 邮政，通信和合作伙伴属于的分类,

* :guilabel:`销售和采购` 标签包括了诸如默认销售员、销售团队等信息，以及网站,

* :menuselection:`日志` 标签提供了该合作伙伴相关的完整 ``通信日志`` (会议, 营销活动,
  线索和商机, 电话访问, emails) . The events the partner has been involved in are created automatically by
  different documents like phone calls, leads, meetings,

* the :menuselection:`Notes` tab is an area for free text notes.

.. i18n: Creating and Updating Partners
.. i18n: ------------------------------
..

创建和更新合作伙伴
------------------------------

.. i18n: Before explaining you how to create a partner, just a quick word on the different ways of representing partners in OpenERP.
.. i18n: `List` view shows a list of customers (the default representation when you click the Customers menu). In this view, you can see several customers at a time.
.. i18n: `Form` view is displayed when you click a specific customer to start editing or when you create a new customer.
..

在讲解如何创建合作伙伴之前，仅说两句OPENERP中合作伙伴不同的显示方式。
`列表` 视图显示客户列表(你点击客户菜单时的默认显示)。这种视图下，你可以同一时间查看到多个客户信息。
当你选择特定客户开始编辑，或者创建一个新客户时，则显示为 `表单` 视图。

.. i18n: To create a new partner (a company, customer, supplier, ...) or to display the list of existing customers, use the menu :menuselection:`Sales --> Address Book --> Customers`. This menu does not only allow you to create a new partner, but also to search for partners.
..

创建一个新的合作伙伴(公司，客户，供应商 ...) 或者打开已存在的客户列表, 使用菜单 :menuselection:`销售 -->地址簿--> 客户` :menuselection:`Sales --> Address Book --> Customers` .
这个菜单不仅可以创建新的合作伙伴，也可以用来查找合作伙伴.

.. figure::  images/crm_partner_default.jpeg

   :align: center

   *客户表单*

.. i18n: .. note:: Mandatory 
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:         Blue fields are always mandatory, meaning that you have to enter a value there. It is impossible to save changes as long as a blue field is not completed.
..

.. note:: 必填项

        蓝色区域是必填项, 意思就是必须在这里输入一个值。只要蓝色区域没有填写完成，就不能保存这次修改。

.. i18n: You should at least enter the company's ``Name`` in the partner form. Some fields are text fields, other fields may be linked to existing data that have been entered elsewhere, such as ``Countries``. 
..

在合作伙伴表单上你至少要输入这个公司的 ``名字`` 。有些字段是文本字段，其他字段可能链接到别的地方已经填写过的数据, 比如 ``国家``。

.. i18n: Create a customer with the following data:
..

根据以下资料创建一个新的客户：

.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Name` : \ ``Smith and Offspring``\ ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Customer` checkbox : \ ``checked``\ ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Supplier` checkbox : \ ``unchecked``\ ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Contact Name` : \ ``Stephen Smith``\ ,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Type` : \ ``Default``\, in the Postal Address section,
.. i18n: 
.. i18n: * :guilabel:`Save` the form.
..

* :guilabel:`名称` : \ ``Smith and Offspring``\ ,

* :guilabel:`客户` 选择框 : \ ``勾选``\ ,

* :guilabel:`供应商` 选择框 : \ ``不勾选``\ ,

* :guilabel:`联系人名称` : \ ``Stephen Smith``\ ,

* :guilabel:`类型` : \ ``默认``\, 在邮政地址部分，

* :guilabel:`保存` 这个表单。

.. i18n: .. tip:: Email
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:       If you use the email gateway, the Outlook or the Thunderbird plugin, do not forget to register an email addresses to each contact, so that the gateway will automatically attach incoming emails to the right partner.
..

.. tip:: 电子邮件

      如果你要使用Email网关，OUTLOOK或者迅雷插件, 请不要忘记给每一个联系人登记Email地址， 那么这个网关就会把自动地接收到的邮件附给对应的合作伙伴.

.. i18n: To update a partner, open the corresponding form, select `Edit` and change the required fields. As explained before, when a company is both one of your customers and a supplier, you just have to edit the partner form once to have changes applied to both customer and supplier.
..

更新合作伙伴信息， 打开对应的表单，选择 `编辑` 然后修改需要更新的字段。正如之前解释过的，当一个公司既是供应商又是客户时，你
只需要编辑一次这个合作伙伴表单，就会自动应用到供应商和客户上。

.. i18n: .. note:: Checkboxes
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:        Why is it important for you to correctly set the Customer and Supplier checkboxes in the partner form? These checkboxes are designed to enable OpenERP to quickly select the partners who should be displayed in some drop-down boxes. An example: when you select a partner in a Sales Quotation, OpenERP will only allow you to select from the list of Customers. And that is precisely what the Customer checkbox is used for. 
..

.. note:: 选择框

      为什么说在合作伙伴表单中正确地设置客户和供应商的选择框是很重要的呢? 这些选择框的设计是为了能让Openerp快速的选择那些
      下拉框显示的合作伙伴。比如：当在一张销售报价单中你要选择一个合作伙伴时， Openerp只允许你在客户列表中选择.这正是客户
      选择框的用处。

.. i18n: Managing your Contacts & Addresses
.. i18n: ----------------------------------
..

管理你的联系人和地址
----------------------------------

.. i18n: You can have several contacts for one partner. Contacts represent company employees that you are in
.. i18n: touch with, along with their address details. For each address you can indicate the type (\ ``Default``\, \ ``Invoice``\, \ ``Delivery``\, \ ``Contact``\   or \ ``Other``\).
..

一个合作伙伴可以有多个联系人。 联系人代表对方公司跟你联系的员工，
还有他们的详细地址。 你可以定义每个地址的类型 (\ ``默认``\, \ ``开票``\, \ ``送货``\, \ ``联系``\   或者 \ ``其他``\)。

.. i18n: Contacts can be entered into the :guilabel:`General` tab of the **Customer** form, or from the list of addresses in the :menuselection:`Sales --> Address Book --> Addresses` menu.
..

联系人信息记录在 **客户** 表单的 :guilabel:`一般` 选项中 ，或者地址列表中 :menuselection:`销售 --> 地址簿 --> 地址` :menuselection:`Sales --> Address Book --> Addresses` 菜单。 

.. i18n: .. tip:: Same Contact, Different Partners 
.. i18n: 
.. i18n:       Do you have contacts who work for several companies, and need to be linked to several partners? Check out the :ref:`ch-contact` chapter.
..

.. tip:: Same Contact, Different Partners 

      你是否有联系人属于多个公司的， 并且需要链接到多个合作伙伴？ 查阅 :ref:`ch-contact` 章节。

.. i18n: OpenERP also allows you to customize the ``Partner`` view to your needs. Click the `Manage Views` option if you want to add fields, delete fields or change the order of fields in a view.
..

OpenERP同样允许根据你的需要定义合作伙伴视图。如果你要添加字段，删除字段或者修改视图中的字段顺序，点击 `管理视图` 选项。

.. i18n: Let us add the ``Birthday`` field to a contact, in the `Addresses` form view. To do so, go to the :menuselection:`Sales -->
.. i18n: Address Book --> Addresses` menu and open any address in Form view. In the right menu bar, click `Manage Views`, then `Edit` because the corresponding view will already be preselected.
..

在 `地址` 表单视图中给联系人添加一个 ``生日`` 字段。要这样做, 转到 :menuselection:`销售(Sales) -->
地址簿(Address Book) --> 地址(Addresses)` 菜单并打开任意一张表单视图。 在右侧菜单栏，点击 `管理视图`, 然后 `编辑`,因为相应的视图已经被选定。

.. i18n: Go to the last line of the view and click the blue plus (+) sign to add a field to the `Communication` group. Proceed as in the figure below, then click the `Update` button.
