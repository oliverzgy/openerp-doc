结语

.. i18n: OpenERP has become established as the main free market-changing alternative for enterprise
.. i18n: management systems
.. i18n: in amongst software from giants such as SAP, Oracle and Microsoft,
.. i18n: and from the small software developers in their own niches.
..
横览企业管理系统这个千变万化生态圈，不管是在诸如SAP、甲骨文（Oracle）、微软（Microsoft）等软件巨头的统治领域，
还是在小型软件开发者的一亩三分地，OpenERP俨然已经树立起自己免费接替者的角色。

.. i18n: Until now, only two main alternatives existed for systems that manage a company's information:
.. i18n: install a proprietary ERP system, complete but usually overweight, inflexible, and expensive;
.. i18n: or develop a solution internally, adapted to current needs but often expensive to develop, not
.. i18n: integrated, and incomplete.
..

迄今为止，企业如何管理自己的信息系统，只有两种方法可选：购买并安装一套专有的、完整的，但常常又是用力过头的、
难以适应改变的，并且是昂贵的ERP系统；或者是内部自行开发一套系统，仅仅适用于现有需求，但进一步开发又非常昂贵、
整合性不高，并且不是很完整。


.. i18n: With its free business model, OpenERP combines the advantages of a complete ERP system with the
.. i18n: flexibility of an in-house solution.
.. i18n: The open source code, the project's general flexibility, and its hundreds of modules
.. i18n: let you construct a solution from a selection of the modules already available and
.. i18n: you can then freely update it as your needs evolve.
..

OpenERP凭借其自由的商业模型，整合了ERP系统应有的完整性和环境可适应性（灵活性）。开发的源代码、项目的通用灵活性，
及其成百上千个模块，可以让你通过适当选择组合，即可构建一套自有的解决方案，并根据发展的需求，自由更新。

.. i18n: The results will be at the top end of what you might expect from any ERP system,
.. i18n: let alone an Open Source system.
.. i18n: The considerable gains in productivity, efficiency and visibility become apparent only a few months
.. i18n: after implementation.
.. i18n: And you can gain from increased operational quality even if you reduce your human resourcing
.. i18n: intensity.
.. i18n: Because there are fewer repetitive tasks for your staff to do,
.. i18n: they can concentrate on higher value-added work.
.. i18n: We frequently receive the gratitude of senior management who get better results from their
.. i18n: business because they have adopted OpenERP.

A SaaS package is suited to the needs of small enterprises that do not have very specific needs, and
where the initial cost and the delay of implementation are critical factors.

.. i18n: To meet its objectives of minimal cost, the SaaS package aims for highly automated standardized data
.. i18n: migrations, minimal support load by training customers well, and a strict limit to the number of
.. i18n: modules offered. So you cannot use your own modules, and are limited to the standard modules that are
.. i18n: included in various package levels.
