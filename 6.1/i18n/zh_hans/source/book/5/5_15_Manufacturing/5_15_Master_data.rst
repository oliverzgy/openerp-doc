使用 BOM
------------------------

.. i18n: Bills of Materials are documents that describe the list of raw materials used to make a finished
.. i18n: product. To illustrate the concept of specification, you will work on a shelf (or cabinet) where the
.. i18n: manufacturing plan is given by the figure :ref:`fig-mrparm2`.
..

物料清单(Bill of Materials)是用来列举制造一个成品所需要的原材料列表。
为了解释本章节的内容，你会生产一个生产计划指定的书架(或橱柜)。 :ref:`fig-mrparm2`.

书架由原材料和中间件(intermediate assemblies)组成。图片编码是指图片，产品参考号OpenERP的是相应的代码。

.. i18n: Change the unit of the Wood Lintel 4m (LIN40) product to ``m`` instead of PCE.
..

        To create the above products, duplicate existing ones, such as Side Panel and Wood 2mm, from the Purchase or Sales menu :menuselection:`Purchases --> Products --> Products`.

.. i18n: To describe how this shelf should be assembled, you define a bill of materials for each intermediate product and for the final shelf assembly. These are shown in the tables below. You can start from the demo data and complete them according to the specifications. To create or change a bill of materials, go to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Master Data --> Bill of Materials`.
..

为了揭示书架是如何组装的(assembled)，你需要定义每个中间件(intermediate product)的BOM以及最终书架的BOM。
BOM内容在下表中显示。你可以由DEMO数据开始，根据指令完成这些BOM。
新建或者更改BOM(bill of materials)，菜单路径为 :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Master Data --> Bill of Materials`.
