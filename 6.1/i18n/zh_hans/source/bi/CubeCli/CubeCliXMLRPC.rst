开源项目的另珍上要素是 - BI, 允许应用程序通过网络服务接收三维数据. Applications issue XML-based queries across a Web-based connection using XML-RPC. Support is focused on XML query languages rather than on OLAP language. 

.. i18n: By providing a flexible, platform-neutral method to render diverse data types, XML has become a standard for exchanging information across heterogeneous applications. Web services, a set of XML based protocols for finding and communicating between loosely-coupled, internet callable application "services" have therefore become the preferred mechanism for integrating heterogeneous applications and enabling service architectures.
